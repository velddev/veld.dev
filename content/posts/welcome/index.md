Hey.

This is just me testing out all the things I can do with this. It feels weird how easy it is to
develop something pretty strong with Gatsby in such a short time. I started writing this setup a
little amount code, and no clear reason what I want to do with this.

It feels absolutely huge that developers have the tools to write a simple blog setup within minutes.
No content management, No weird cli tools, Nothing. it's refreshing.
Alright I think that's all I wanted to write about for now.

Thanks.
